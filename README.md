## Learn Linux TV - Bash Scripting
To find which shell you are currently using issue the following the command:
<code>echo $SHELL</code>

If you are not using the Bash shell you can switch by entering: <code>which bash</code> which will show the path to bash.  You must type in the path to switch to Bash.  

At the start of every Bash script you must have the shebang <code>#!/bin/bash</code>. This tells script which interpreter the script is supposed to use. Once you have created a script it needs to be made executable.  This can be done by using the chmod command as follows: <code>chmod +x /path/to/file</code>.
